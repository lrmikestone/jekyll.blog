<p>Looking for comments?</p>

<p>I don't have comments on this site as they're difficult to manage and take up too much time. I'd rather concentrate on producing content than managing comments.</p>

<p>Instead of leaving a comment, feel free to contact me <a href="/contact">contact me</a> instead.</p>
