<p>Looking for comments? There are no comments. It's not that I don't care what you think, it's just that I don't want to manage a comments section.</p>

<p>
  If you want to comment, there's a really good chance I at least mentioned this post on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@mike">Fosstodon</a>, and you can reply to me there.
  If you don't have a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> account, I'd suggest giving it a try.
</p>

<p>If you don't want to join Mastodon, and you still want to comment, feel free to use my <a href="/contact">contact</a> information.</p>

<p>Also, don't feel obligated, but if you feel like buying me a ☕ <a href="https://ko-fi.com/mikestone">cup of coffee</a> ☕ I won't say no.
