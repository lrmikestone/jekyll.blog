First things first, I’m not going to be doing technicalities. There will be no “I’m the oldest of three” when I’m the oldest of four (neither of those are true by the way). If you’d like to answer, I’ll be posting this on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org), so you can simply reply to me on your Mastodon account. If you *don’t have* a Mastodon account, I highly suggest you get one! Just go to [Join Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) and find an instance that matches your particular tastes. Once you’ve done that, you can find me [here](https://fosstodon.org/@mike). 

If you’ve got any other questions, feel free to hit me up on Mastodon too. I’m pretty much there all the time.

So, here we go.

2. My parents encouraged me to learn about computers when I was a kid.
3. I’ve personally compiled the Linux kernel on multiple occasions.
