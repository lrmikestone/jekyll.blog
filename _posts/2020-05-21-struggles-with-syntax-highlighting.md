Day 27 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

When I finally caved to [Kev's](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) nagging about spinning my blog back up again, I chose [Write.as](https://write.as) has my platform of choice to get that done. I have reasons why, and maybe someday I'll talk about it. Today I want to talk about something pseudo-related. Markdown syntax highlighting.

<!--more-->

As most of the people who read this will know, [write.as](https://write.as) uses markdown for it's syntax. Honestly, when I first fired up my account, I didn't know much about markdown, and I still have to bring up the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) more often than I'd like to admit, but I've really grown to like it.

Also, most of the people who know me know that I like vi(m), and I use it to edit text more often than pretty much any other editor.

Except for markdown.

Maybe it's me, but I just _can not_ get vi(m) to look good highlighting markdown (and yes, I've tried emacs). 

Python:

C:

Markdown:

This is even after working on it for a while. I installed the PlasticBoy [vim-markdown](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown) addon to get this much. Prior to that, it was just plain text. Plain as plain could be.

	Oh, and before anybody mentions it, I realized after I took this screen shot that I was missing ~s on the strike through. I fixed it later.```  

Because I've had so much difficulty with syntax highlighting in vi(m), I've been using GUI tools fill the void. The two that I've really settled on are [Ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) and [Typora](https://typora.io). 

I've found both to be really good, and I've so far been unable to decide which is my favorite. I write with Ghostwriter more often, but Typora is still in my launcher right next to it. 

Do you have a favorite and why?
