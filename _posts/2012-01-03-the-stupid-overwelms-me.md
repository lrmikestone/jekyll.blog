Today I read what I can only say is the most stupid explanation for why people choose Windows over Linux (or Mac for that matter). I couldn't even think of a response.

"Its like this question - if you take a baby girl and a baby boy and place them on a deserted island with just food and water, would they know how to reproduce. The answer is yes they will because it is part of human nature and is natural. As is Windows is natural to a PC. Linux and OS X no matter how good they are, just aren't a natural choice."

I don't usually dedicate a whole post to something like this, but the sheer magnitude of the stupid demands it.
