Day 1 of the #100DaysToOffload series:

Many of the people reading this will come to my blog from Mastodon. I spend most of my “Social Media” time there, so that’s how most people will know me. For those that don’t, I want to give a brief explanation of what’s going on here with this #100DaysToOffload stuff.

A good friend of mine, [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk) recently suggested a “100 Days to Offload” challenge. This is a challenge to those individuals with a blog to post one thing a day for 100 days straight. I have a blog, kind of. I’ve written somewhere in the neighborhood of a post a year for the last couple years. Coming up with something to write about for one hundred days straight certainly would be a challenge for me. So, I took it.

I’m not the only one doing this. [Kev himself](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) has decided that he’s going to take part, as have others. Several are hosting their blogs on the [write.as](https://write.as) platform, which makes it easy for anybody interested to follow along. Anybody that uses the tag #100DaysToOffload will show up on [write.as's reader site](https://read.write.as/t/100daystooffload). You can add that to your favorite RSS reader, or just hit the web page when you’re curious. 

Now, there’s no specific theme to this challenge. I can write about anything I want. I’m probably going to try to focus mostly on tech, specifically open source stuff, since that’s what I know. Just don’t be surprised if I throw in something completely off the cuff because I can’t think of anything “techy” to write about on a given day.

OK, I guess that’s enough of the Mikespaining. Let the games begin!
