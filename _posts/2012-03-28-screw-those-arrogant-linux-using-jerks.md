I've been using Linux now for quite a while. I couldn't even tell you when I first tried it. I can place a general time around 1997 or 1998. Probably 1997. So, if my math isn't truly horrible, about 15 years with Linux. During that time, I've had many, _many_ computers. I think Linux is amazing and right now, I wouldn't use anything else, but I can say that it hasn't always worked perfectly for me. When I've had troubles with it, I've done what every other person does when they have troubles. First, I Google. Second, I ask friends. Third, I go to the forums. I can't think of a single negative experience I've had in the process.

Over the years, I've talked to many different people about Linux. Not all of them are fans. That's just the way of humans. One thing that I've run into with some of the more.... let's call them "unreasonable" people is the claim that "getting support from the Linux forums is a horrible experience. Linux users are rude, arrogant, condescending, blah blah blah." Getting support for Linux is a really negative experience for them.

But here's the trick.

Out of the people that I've seen make this claim I know a handful well enough to say, they're dicks. Absolute assholes. Seeing them claim that the people on the Linux forums are big meanies just makes me wonder. Was the person hanging around the Linux forums just waiting to help out people that need a hand and receives no compensation other than personal satisfaction the rude, arrogant, and condescending one?

If you need to go to the forums and ask a Linux question, that's fine. Be nice about it. These people aren't paid to put up with your shit. Try to do a little research before hand and not just wade in expecting them to solve all your problems. If they have questions for you, that's normal. I can absolutely guarantee you that no matter how much detail you put into your question, you missed something that might be important. If they start out with basic questions, don't be offended. They deal with a lot of people, and not all of them are computer experts. They don't know you.

_Above all_, show some respect. You're coming to _them_ for help. They don't need anything from you. If you cop a 'tude, expect them to ignore your whiny ass. It's not because they're rude, or arrogant, or condescending. It's because you're being a prick, and if you're going to be a prick, you can fix your own goddamn problems.
