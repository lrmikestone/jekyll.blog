It's been a while since I've updated this blog, so I thought that I'd throw something up here to let everybody who reads this but doesn't follow me on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org) I'm still around. I've spent the better part of a week in a rented cabin. Roughing it for the family is having a toaster oven instead of a microwave and internet that's only in the two to three megabit range. Streaming video to the TV is a little sketchy most days, and it's only 720p. So, since the tech in our cabin isn't the greatest, we've been swimming and hiking and doing things outdoors. My kids have been less than thrilled by this situation, or at least that's what they're saying most of the time. I do occasionally catch them having fun in spite of themsevles though. I'm not looking forward to getting back to the big city and the high temperatures, but it's coming soon. Not going to rush.
