The title says it all. I'm back.

For those of you that don't keep up on my day to day schedule, I spent the last week on holiday. It was a good break. I didn't go tech free like I have in the past. Since I was away from my normal haunts, I just needed to look up too much information, and use maps, and blah blah blah. Lots of needs for technology unlike some of my previous holidays.

Despite not going tech free this time around, I did cut back on a lot of it. I'm involved with techonlogy both personally and professionally, and some of my personal "hobbies" have taken on some professional aspects as well, but that's a tale for another day. I spent very little time on social media, which is a pretty big change for me when it comes to [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org), and I cut back on my news binge. Most of what I did do I did on my phone. I had a computer with me, but it was mostly just in case work required my intervention. It didn't happen this time around, but it has happened in the past.

So, I'm back. Lots of stuff on the plate to catch up on both at work and at home. I have to figure out why [Fosstodon's](https://fosstodon.org) translation service sucks so much for one. 

Sorry, this post is more of a train of thought thing than anything else. I'm trying to get my head back into my usual headspace, and not my vacation headspace. It's going to take a bit.
