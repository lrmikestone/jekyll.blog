Well, the title pretty much gives it all away. I'm going back to school. I've gotten classes signed up for and I'm ready to begin.

Soooooo, I'm ready to begin. Except my first class doesn't start until September. Weirdly, that's just flat out annoying. I'm guessing there are people reading this that weren't even alive the last time I took a college couse, and now that I've made the decision to get this thing going I really want to get started. But I have to wait.

Since besides being a newly minted (slightly used?) college student, I'm also a parent of kids who are also in school (not college yet) and I'm still working a full time job, I'm not going to be pushing myself right away. This first semester I'm only taking 7 credits, and they're all your basic first year kind of classes. I'll see how much focus I can put on classes and studying, and how these classes turn out in the end. After that I'll re-evaluate how many credits I can pull off at the same time. If I've got the bandwidth I'll see about taking more next time around.

Until then....

I guess I just wait and wait and wait some more.
