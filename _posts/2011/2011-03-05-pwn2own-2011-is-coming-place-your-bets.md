The Pwn2Own 2011 contest is right around the corner. It's going to be March 9th, 10th, and 11th. It looks like Linux will be not participating again this year with the exception of Android. Maybe that's because it's a foregone conclusion that it won't be Pwned. Who knows.

Android is in the mix this year in the mobile category. Here's the contenders:

- Dell Venue Pro running Windows 7
- iPhone 4 running iOS
- Blackberry Torch 9800 running Blackberry 6 OS
- Nexus S running Android

My predictions are they will fall in this order:

1. iPhone 4.
2. Dell Venue Pro
3. Blackberry.
4. Android.

I really was torn about 3 and 4 (but 1 and 2 were easy). Blackberry has been shown to be fairly security aware. I guess time will tell.

What are your predictions?
