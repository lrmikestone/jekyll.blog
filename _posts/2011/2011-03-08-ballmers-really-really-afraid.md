In an article by [Bloomberg](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-03-07/microsoft-is-said-to-pay-nokia-more-than-1-billion-in-deal.html) today, it was revealed that Microsoft is forking over more than $1,000,000,000 to Nokia to have them make Windows 7 phones. That's 9 zeros there folks. Despite the fact that Microsoft has handed over (or is in the process of handing over) an extremely large sum of money, [it doesn't seem to be reversing their fortunes](http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/2011/03/07/windows-phone-7-not-reversing-microsofts-mobile-slide/) any.

Steve Ballmer must be very afraid of Google and the Android platform. VERY.
