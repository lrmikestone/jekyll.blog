So tonight I fired up for the first time Ubuntu 11.10, or what will become Ubuntu 11.10 here in a couple months.

It's pretty much what you'd expect to see in any alpha release software. BUGS. Everywhere. I did manage to check on a couple things before I turned the machine off, and I see that LibreOffice is still the default office suite. The installed version is 3.3.2, but look for that to change before the release version, probably in alpha 2 since 3.4 is already available. Firefox is still the default browser, and of course, Unity is still the default interface.

I honestly didn't see a lot of changes in the interface. There was some graphical changes to the icons and my default wallpaper didn't come up at all. The title bar looked the same as it was in 11.04.

All in all, not a whole lot has visibly changed yet, but I do expect that to change before to very long. I'm looking forward to seeing what Alpha 2 has in store for us.
