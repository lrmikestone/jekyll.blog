Recently, a friend of mine and I were discussing his phone and his desire to buy the iPhone 5 to replace his Android phone. Personally, think moving from an Android to an iPhone is a mistake, but that's not really the point of this particular posting.

During the course of the conversation, the phrase came up "It just works." I've heard this phrase countless times over the years to describe one OS or another, and it's always seemed weird to me.

For something to "just work", the task that you're trying to perform has to be within the subset of tasks the device is inherently capable of. For example, if I were to want to browse the web, in today's day and age, pretty much any computer or smart phone I picked up would "just work". They all come with built in web browsers and networking capability. So the claim "it just works" could apply to any of them. A secondary, counter example would be, if I were to want to dig a hole in my back yard. Now, short of using the case as some sort of digging device, none of those devices could claim to "just work".

What this really boils down to is this: Whether a device "just works" or not is subjective to a particular persons needs.

For me (and I'd go so far as to claim most people), what I need in a computer is simple.

1. I need a word processor. This doesn't have to be Microsoft Word, or Lotus something or other. To often, people get tied up in names. I'd be willing to bet that Open Office or LibreOffice can perform most if not all tasks required of an average user.
2. I need a spread sheet. Again, it doesn't  have to be a particular brand name, and again, Open Office or LibreOffice more than meet the needs of the majority.
3. I need access to the Web. Linux supports Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and other web browsers. All are capable of browsing the vast majority of the web.
4. I need to view graphics. I have a digital camera and two kids. I want to see video and images of those kids on my computer. Linux more than covers these bases, and does so with ease and style. No issues there.

So, when it really comes down to it, Linux does all the things that the average person requires from their OS. On top of those things, it's easy to use, stable, and close enough to being virus free that it makes the Mac look like a cesspool of infection.

Based on those facts, I think it's safe to say it.

Linux:  It just works.
