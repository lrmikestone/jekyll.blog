The sad announcement was made today (Saturday, April 09 2011). PJ is calling it done over at Groklaw. While I'm sad to hear that she's calling it a day, I would like to thank her for all her hard work in the name of Linux. Go over toÂ [http://www.groklaw.net](http://www.groklaw.net/) to read her explanation as to why.

Thanks PJ! We'll miss you!
