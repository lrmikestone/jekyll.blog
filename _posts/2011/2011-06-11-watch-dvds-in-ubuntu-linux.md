I've recently run into a startling number of people that think you can't play DVDs in Linux. I'm sure this idea came about because it _is_ true that you can't play DVDs in Linux _by default_, but you can install software that gives you the capability, and it's amazingly easy.

I found 4 easy steps on [dreamingisdigital.com](http://www.dreamingisdigital.com/) that walked me through it with no problems. The original article can be found [here](http://www.dreamingisdigital.com/2011/05/13/how-to-play-dvds-in-ubuntu-11-04/).

Step 1. Open a Terminal Window Step 2. Type sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras Step 3. Type sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh Step 4. Insert DVD and enjoy.

If you have any questions about this process please feel free to let me know. If you don't, I hope you enjoy watching your DVDs in Linux!
