Day 12 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

I've been using Linux for a long time. I know some very brilliant people on Fosstodon and in real life that weren't born when I started using Linux. For as long as I remember, Linux has been vacillating between 1% and 3% of the desktop market, so when I see numbers that show me a rapid change in the market, I take it with a grain of salt.

I'm a huge fan of Linux. I would like nothing more than to see Linux succeed massively in the desktop computer market. [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) has been bleeding the market dry for years for operating systems and office suites. It would never have been able to do that if it didn't already have a monopoly on the market before it became a staple to the modern home.

Recently it was [in the news](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/05/linux-marketshare-april-2020) that Linux had a sudden and massive spike in usage. In fact, even [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) has been [seeing an increase](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3199373/windows-by-the-numbers-windows-share-shrinks-linux-surges-wait-linux.html). 

Look, I'd really love to see Microsoft start a steady decline and have an Linux take it's place as the most used desktop OS in the world. I know there are people that don't. Some people like the exclusivity of the whole thing, and others just think that having all those extra people would make Linux the same dumpster fire that Windows is right now. I get both those arguments, but I'm not one of those people.

Despite that, please forgive me if I'm not ecstatic about this recent development. I think it's a good sign, sure, but I need to see this go on for six months to a year before I believe that there's any significant shift in the current market norms. 

I hate being the guy that ruins the party, so forgive me for my dire attitude. Fingers crossed that this _is_ actually the new normal. I sincerely hope that's the case.
