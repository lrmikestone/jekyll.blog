Day 6 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

I’m going to branch out a little bit today. Here in the United States, April is National Poetry Month (#NationalPoetryMonth). 

<!--more-->

> National Poetry Month was launched by the Academy of American Poets in April 1996 to remind the public that poets have an integral role to play in our culture and that poetry matters. Over the years, it has become the largest literary celebration in the world, with tens of millions of readers, students, K–12 teachers, librarians, booksellers, literary events curators, publishers, and, of course, poets, marking poetry's important place in our lives. 

Since today is the 30th of April, and it’s the last day of National Poetry Month, I thought throw something out there into the world. I’m not much of a poet (or any kind of a poet), so I’m going to stick to a haiku.

No throwing tomatoes.

OK, now that I’ve done that, no more poetry from me until at least next April. I apologize in advance.
