On the 25th of April, 2020, I made my first post after accepting the #100DaysToOffload challenge issued by [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev). Today, I’m making my 100th post. So, how did it go? Was it everything you ever wanted and more?

Honestly, there were many, many days that I didn’t expect to be making this post. Historically, I haven’t been the best at keeping up with my blog. Often, I start projects and am fired up about them until I get about 75% of the way, and then I lose interest and they fall by the wayside. 

I half expected this to be the case when I accepted Kev’s challenge. I didn’t plan on not finishing, but I’m old enough to have seen my past behavior and tried to correct it many times, each time failing.

I’d have to say the biggest challenge I had with this, other than just doing the writing, was thinking of things to write about. It’s the thing I never understand about people who write for a living. How do you write about a subject every day, or every couple days, and still find fresh material? I found myself revisiting subject matter a lot. #Pine64 devices. #Vivaldi. #Mycroft. Time and again I dipped into those wells, and I felt like people reading just _had_ to be getting sick of those subjects.

Will I do it again next year? 

I’m not sure yet. I do want to keep the blog alive, and I like that there’s something that’s really keeping me honest when it comes to updating it. I need to be making a post every couple days, or I’ll run out of days in the year. I need to take an honest look at what I’m writing about, and how I’m writing about it, and decide if this is something I can continue. Technology is a constantly evolving field, so it feels like I can find enough things to write about to do something every couple days. There are professional writers (of which I am _not_) who pull off daily articles all year round. It feels like I should be able to do  (badly) every couple days what they do (well) daily. 

I plan on continuing to write, and might even diversify my subject matter a bit. The entire 100 days has been technology related other than a day or two where I just blathered because I couldn’t think of anything else to write. I will let the “pressure” of the 100 days drop for a couple weeks until 2021, and then reevaluate after the new year. 

Until then, it’s been fun! Thanks for the challenge Kev.
