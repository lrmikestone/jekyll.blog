Day 56 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

I wasn't paying attention to the iUniverse, and the WWDC kind of snuck up on me. I didn't get a chance to go through all of Apple's announcements, or any of them in great detail, but I wanted to do a quick look at iOS 14.

Eleven years ago today, I posted this on my Twitter account:

> Greetings to all... This is my first message from my new iPhone 3Gs..

Of course, I followed that up two years later with my post about how the [iPhone 3Gs was the worst phone I ever owned](https://mikestone.me/iphone-3gs-the-worst-phone-ive-ever-owned). That still holds true.

With that context in place, I will straight out tell you that I am no fan of Apple. I don't own a Mac. The iPad we had which my wife got for work is broken and no longer works. We don't own any iPhones. I don't plan on changing any of those any time soon.

So, today Apple announced iOS 14. My initial impression of the "feature list" is that Tim Cook sat down with his executives and made a list of features Android had that iOS didn't and said, "Let's do that!"

1. Widgets
2. Picture in picture
3. Wind down mode
4. Apple Translate
5. etc
6. etc

It was really amazing to read through the list. I'm sure iFans are ecstatic about all the "innovation" Goo... err.... Apple has done with this newest release.

I'm going to go through [this](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3563751/wwdc-everything-apple-shared-at-its-big-developer-event.html) and read it in more detail tomorrow since I completely blew it off today, but so far what I've seen does not impress me.
