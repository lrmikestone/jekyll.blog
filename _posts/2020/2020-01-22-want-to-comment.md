So, you want to comment on something on this page. I get it. Hopefully you have something nice to say. I fully understand and I want to support your desire to comment, but there's a few things I also want to do.

1. I want to respect your privacy. many comment systems are designed to suck as much information out of you as possible so companies like Google or Amazon can sell you products. I don't even want to be involved in that mess.
2. I don't want to spend all my time dealing with comment systems. There are comment systems out there that do respect your privacy, but frankly I barely have time to have a blog let alone deal with all the minutia of a comment system.

So, how do I work around those two points and still let you comment?

Well, this blog is powered by my friends at [Write.As](https://write.as "Write.As"). I've configued the option to federate my posts out into the Fediverse so my blog can be followed there. If you don't already have an account, I'd highly suggest going to [JoinMastodon](https://joinmastodon.org "Join Mastodon") and clicking the "Get Started" button. Choose an instance that works for you, and once your _privacy respecting_ account is setup, you can find my blog posts listed under @blog at mikestone.me. You can also find me [@mike@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@mike) if you have any questions or concerns.

I hope to hear from you soon!
