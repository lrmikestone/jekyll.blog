Day 39 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

Everybody has their way of working on their desktop. Personally, I use plank to add a panel down at the bottom. Pretty much everything I use is there.

I don't use a lot of applications on my computer. I'm pretty boring when it comes to my default list. I thought I'd go through my default picks and hopefully some of you will return the favor.

1. The first icon, far left, is the "Show Desktop" icon. I leave this here, and I even sometimes use it. I want to do it enough that the icon has a home.
2. The next three icons are my terminals. MATE Terminal, Tilix, and Snowflake. I've already written [a post](https://mikestone.me/how-many-terminals-do-i-need) about my use of three of them instead of just the one. Of course, I still have the Guake hiding up above.
3. After my three terminals come my three browsers, [Vivaldi](https://www.vivaldi.com), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), and [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org). Maybe in the future I'll write an another post about why I have three browsers sitting there, but not today.
4. Filezilla. I spend enough time in this app for work that it feels weird not having it available. Honestly, I don't use it nearly as much at home.
5. Foliate. This is a writing app that I'm testing out. I don't think it's going to be around long just because even though it seems good, I don't have a use for it.
6. Two markdown editors, [ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) and [Typora](https://typora.io). I have the both of these because I can't decide which one I like more. I'm leaning towards ghostwriter at the moment, but they're both good.
7. LibreOffice Writer and Calc. Just because.
8. Caja. Mostly I use this because I generate files on my laptop and then move them to my Synology.
9. Control Center, cause I sometimes decide to completely mess up my system.
10. Finally, Rhythmbox. Sometimes you just can't work without some music.

Some of these come and go, but most of them are there to stay. I'm sure we all have the apps that are a default part of our workflow.
