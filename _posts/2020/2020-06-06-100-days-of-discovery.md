Day 41 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

Forty-one days ago, I started the #100DaysToOffload challenge. [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) made the challenge, and I had serious doubts I was going to complete it. I'm not one hundred percent confident now, and I'm forty-one days in. There has been one thing about it that I didn't expect.

I've put up a number of posts regarding the software I use on my computer. Terminals, write.as, Roblox, Mycroft, etc. The conversation on those posts has always been great despite the fact I don't have comments on my blog.

The thing I didn't expect (and maybe should have) was the number of suggestions I've gotten to accomplish tasks I'm already doing in a less good way.

Joplin is one that I've really liked, and it was something that was introduced to me as a result of this blog.

Today I read [a blog](https://robert.winter.ink/updating-my-plank) by [Robert Winter](https://qoto.org/@rw) in which I actually make a cameo appearance. In the "What's on my plank" portion, he mentions an app called [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org). I was interested, and I'm looking into using it.

There seems to be a lot of crossover in what I use Joplin for and what I'd use Zotero for, but I think I can use both of them productively. I can't say for certain, but Zotero just might cure [my tab problem](https://mikestone.me/my-problem-with-tabs).
