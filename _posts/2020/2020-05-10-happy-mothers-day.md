Day 16 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

Today was Mother’s Day here in the United States, and in many other countries world wide. I’d like to say that I have something profound to say to celebrate the day, but I don’t. I spent the day with my wife and children, and called my Mom because I can’t go see her because her care facility is in lock down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I hope everybody had a good day. Take care, be healthy.
