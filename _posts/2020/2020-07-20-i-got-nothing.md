There are days when I sit down at my keyboard to write something for this blog, and the ideas just flow. I might have two or three articles going on in my head, and I only decide which one is going on what day at the very last moment. Today is _not_ one of those days. Today, I got nothing.

I got an article forwarded to me from the [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai) list, but I've probably written enough about Mycroft for the time being. I'll be revisiting it again before the end of the #100DaysToOffload series.
