Day 59 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

I fired up my virtual machine today and finally tried out UbuntuDDE. The short and sweet of it is that this is a _pretty_ distro.

The initial installation was a little rough for me, but I think that's more to do with the VM software than anything else. I had the ISO stored out on my Synology and the installation was crashing the VM over and over. After moving the ISO over to my local drive, the install went through perfectly.

After the initial installation was complete, the desktop was really nice. It had a really refined feel to it. There was a standard bar down at the bottom which housed the shortcut icons as well as a power button and a round clock. The gear button brought up a fancy, and quite literal, control panel on the left hand side.

I _really_ liked this implementation. It put all the settings in one really easy, scrollable panel. 

Most of the rest of the interface was pretty standard. There was a launcher icon in the panel that brought up a very Gnome looking icon screen.

All in all, I really liked this distro. It was a little sluggish in the VM, but not unusably so. I didn't have the chance to try it out bare metal, but I'm looking forward to it tomorrow. I doubt I'm going to do a full installation, but I'll load it up off a USB stick to give it a full test.

Just in the hour I had to use it today, I really liked it. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try if you've got in the inclination.
