Day 42 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

When the Brave browser was first released four years ago, I gave it a try. It was OK, but not something I'd use on a regular basis. I quickly went back to my old browser. Now, there are other reasons I don't use Brave.

I don't like advertising on the web. It started small and it's spiraled out of control. I know people are making content and they want to get paid for that content. As a personal preference, I'd rather they put content behind a paywall than weigh every page down with advertising.

I've mentioned this before, but the web used to be such a simple place. Content was there, and the content was the point of the exercise. It wasn't drawing people in with their "And Then This Happened" headlines. 

In my opinion, advertising has made the web worse. 

The point of the web browser isn't to remove all the advertising on a page. It's to remove parts of it and replace others. 

On top of that, Brave seems kind of "sketchy" to me. They've [done things in the past](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/03/30/news-telegram-appeals-injunction-adaptive-capital-fails-the-story-of-the-petro/) that I don't like, and they've [done things rather recently](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/06/06/the-brave-web-browser-is-hijacking-links-and-inserting-affiliate-codes/) that I don't like.

What this equates to is they don't solve the problem I'm wanting to solve, and they do the bit they do in a way that makes me uncomfortable. At this point I'm not sure I'd switch to Brave even if they did "fix" the web the way I'd like it to be.
