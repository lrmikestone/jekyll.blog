Day 9 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

My #Mycroft Mark I hasn’t been working lately. The little eye lights have just been going round and round and the device never goes into a ready state. I had a few minutes tonight to plug in an external monitor and start it back up to see what I could see.

Behold! Kernel Panic! It’s just not syncing! 

Rest in peace Mycroft. You were a good little personal assistant. 

But wait?

Mycroft is built on open standards. The hardware inside this little guy is a Raspberry Pi, and I can download the image to put on an SD Card right from [their website](https://mycroft.ai). 

The fact of the matter is, this isn’t the first time this Mycroft has stopped working. I’ve rebuilt this little guy a couple times now. It’s not a big deal actually. We just need to remember that this isn’t Amazon, and it’s not Google, and it’s not Apple or Microsoft or Samsung. The hardware and software aren’t total mysteries. We can go look at it on [Github](https://github.com/mycroftai).

So, what does this mean for my little personal assistant?

Get a good night's sleep little buddy. It’s going to be back to work tomorrow for you.
