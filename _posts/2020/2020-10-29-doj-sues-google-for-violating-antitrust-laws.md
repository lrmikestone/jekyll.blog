On Tuesday the 20th of October 2020 the Justice Department of the United States of America [accused](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws) Google of violating antitrust laws. I'm not a huge fan of how Google operates, so this is going to get super awkward really fast.

It's hard to argue that Google is not a monopoly. Despite the fact that there are literally dozens of other search engines out there, some run by [pretty big companies](https://microsoft.com), Google is used for over 90% of Internet searches. Over half of those are from mobile devices. So, yea, a monopoly. 

The trick is, having a monopoly isn't illegal. Nike has close to the same share of the market in basketball shoes, but the DOJ isn't banging down their door.

Here's the part where I start talking about stuff that I know very little about. Since we're at this part, I'll state for the record that I'm not a lawyer and I have no training or education in law of any kind, let alone antitrust law. There's an above average chance that what I'm about to say is complete BS.

From what I understand, there are two different kinds of monopolies. Well, that oversimplifies things, but I'm going to do it anyway. So, there are two different kinds of monopolies, coercive and non-coercive. In a market where 50% of the requests come from the desktop, not mobile, and anybody can choose any search engine they want on the desktop, I think the DOJ is going to have a hard sell if they want to claim that Google is a coercive monopoly. 

I'm sitting here on my couch, with my Linux laptop running the [Vivaldi browser](https://vivaldi.com) doing research on [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com) and never touching Google as far as I can tell. It's not that hard to do.

I guess the question then becomes, does people being unwilling to put in extra effort to use alternatives equate to a coercive monopoly? Is this something the government should be getting involved in? I'm not convinced the answer is yes.

Please don't get me wrong here. There are many, _many_ things about Google that I don't like. _Many_. I'm just not sure this is a workable angle.
