Day 49 of the #100DaysToOffload Series:

Five days ago on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org), [Pine64](https://pine64.org) announced the availability of the PineTab. When they first introduced the Pinebook Pro, I hesitated. This time I didn't make the same mistake.

When Pine64 made [their announcement](https://fosstodon.org/@PINE64/104318266506485487), I was quick to get to the store. Years ago I purchased a Pixel C, and other than the inherent "Googliness" of it, I really like the form factor. 

I like the tablet with the detachable keyboard, but I wish it had a "desktop" that I could use and that apps wouldn't fight me regarding screen orientation. I wish it had a built in touchpad or mouse. I wish Google would support their tablet for more than two years. 

In short, it was nice while it lasted, but there were several things about it I would love to improve upon.

Now, my PineTab is coming soon (hint hint hint @Pine64@fosstodon.org), and Pine64 has remedied pretty much everything about the Pixel C that I didn't like.

There's a normal laptop keyboard, a usable touchpad, and a deskto..... er. Wait a minute. What desktop does it have?

Well, it turns out the PineTab comes with UBPorts. I've been meaning to install UBPorts on an old Nexus 7 (2013) I have, but my Mom has been using it and I haven't had access or opportunity, so I'm super excited to try it. 

As excited as I am about that opportunity, there are also other versions of Linux that can be used. According to the [PineTab Wiki](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTab), the device itself will "technically" "use any ARM distro".

This opens up a world of opportunity.

There are a couple that are specifically designed to work on tablets or phones, like the aforementioned UBPorts, as well as [postmarketOS](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTab#postmarketOS) and [Arch Linux Arm](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTab#Arch_Linux_ARM).

Now I have a conundrum. The PineTab automatically boots from a microSD if a bootable card is found, so I can easily swap different distros in and out as often as I want. 

So, where do I begin?
