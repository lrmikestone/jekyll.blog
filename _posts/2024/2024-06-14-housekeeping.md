It's looking pretty dusty around here. As I [noted yesterday](https://mikestone.me/random-blog-post1), it's been a while since I've put anything up. Also, it's been a while since I've done any kind of work on this site in general.

I think it goes without saying that if I was struggling to find time in my schedule to put up a blog post, I probably wasn't digging through the code of the site either. So, what have I been doing instead?

* Job
* Marriage
* Kids
* Kids' School Stuff
* College
* [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org)

Just a few things that take a minute or two out of my day. Still, I _do_ want to get back into this. One thing I thought of doing when I went back to school was to use this blog as a kind of journal to log my daily activities. That never materialized obviously, but I still think it's not a horrible idea. 

While I'm deciding whether I can manage to do a daily post, I think I'm going to see what I can do as far as this site's design. I had to learn HTML back in the 90s for a class, but at least for that particular class CSS wasn't really a thing, so I've always been garbage at CSS. Thankfully (maybe?) I have a class later this summer where CSS is actually going to be something we cover, so I have an opportunity to get some college level training on how to do CSS. I'm going to use that opportunity to learn some hopefully new and interesting things I can do with this site. 

Stay tuned I guess, assuming there's anybody out there reading this anyway.
