[Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) did his annual [My Default Apps at the End of 2024](https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2024), so I thought I'd steal his list wholesale and update it for my own apps. Some of these just aren't applicable to me, like presenations. I just don't do them, so I don't have a default app for them.
