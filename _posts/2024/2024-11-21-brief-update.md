Just a quick update.

Today I did manage to pick up a USB adapter for my speakers. I plugged it in and the stupid things showed up immediately. No fuss no muss. The integrated sound just didn't want to let Linux play with that port. Oh well. Honestly, the port for the speakers is just a standard headphone jack and it's on the front. This is a mini-pc, so it's already got cables sticking out of it at all angles. I attached a USB hub to it and pulled the hub back from the PC, and it makes everything look much cleaner anyway. I've got some rearranging to do on the desk still (didn't get to it yet) which will make my whole setup much more clean looking. Oh, and I _seriously_ need to dust. Like, a lot. I might need a shovel.
