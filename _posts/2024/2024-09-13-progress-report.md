On the 16th of August, I started up a new 100 Days to Offload challenge. So, how are things going?

<!--more-->

This will be my 21st post of the series. Since I started on the 16th of August, that means it's been 28 days since I started. This is the 21st post, so I've missed 7 days. There are 118 days left in the year, and I've got to make 79 posts in those 118 days. That gives me a buffer of 39 days I can _not_ post and still make my goal. Honestly, that doesn't sound too bad. 

The hardest part of doing this challenge like this is I'm just not that interesting of a person. It's difficult to come up with something to post about almost every day. It's even more difficult to come up with something to post about almost every day that anybody else will ever want to read.

The other part about this abbreviated schedule is burnout. I've got a new college class starting soon, and lots of other things going on. I don't have a lot of free time on my calendar. This adds just one more thing to consume my limited free time. With only 79 more of these to go, I'm not calling it quits. More whining about decisions I've made than anything else. 

OK, I'm calling this one. This is one that no one in their right mind is going to read. Well, let's do a test. Anybody that read this, hit me up on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@mike) to let me know. For some reason I doubt I'm going to have to mute my notifications. That's the end. I've got to be up in 6 hours, and I need to get _some_ sleep before then. 

Until next time.

Day 21 of the #100DaysToOffload Series.
