Well, I'm back once again, attempting to do the [100 Days to Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge for a second time. 

<!--more-->

So, there I was, minding my own business for a change, when I got a message on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org).

<quote>ðŸ‘‹Hi @mike I read your last 2 posts on your blog. We both want to write. How about we start #100DaysToOffload series together and compete to finish before Dec, 31st? :eyeroll: Let's pull some time to read and write.</quote>

I check the calendar, and it's the 8th of August. Some quick back of the napkin math shows me this _is_ possible, but considering my full schedule and traditionally lacking motivation, it would be tough to pull off.

So, why the heck not give it a try?

I said yes, let's do this thing! 

So here we are, post #1 of a whole new #100DaysToOffload series. I'm going to warn everybody ahead of time: With this abbreviated window of time, I'm going to have to be cranking something out almost daily. This could start to border
on spam. So sorry about that in advance. I'm going to try to keep this interesting and not make posts about what I had for dinner or anything like that, but let's be honest, some days are more boring than others. Fingers cross things
go well. 

See you tomorrow!

Day 1 of the #100DaysToOffload Series.
