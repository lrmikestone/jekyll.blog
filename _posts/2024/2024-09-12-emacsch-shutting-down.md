This isn't a new development, but it's something that I only learned today. The [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) instance [emacs.ch](https://emacs.ch/about) is shutting down as of December 9th, 2024. 

<!--more-->

The admin of the instance published a [post](https://emacs.ch/@emacs/113087752901949391) with their reasoning for the shutdown. It _sounds_ to me like there's something more going on, but I'm not delving into all the details. I don't know specifically when emacs.ch came online, but it's been here for a couple years. I wanted to put up part of the message their admin posted.

<blockquote>After almost two years of dedicated service to our community, I'm tired.</blockquote>

This I can understand. Maintaining an instance can be exhausting. If we didn't have such a great, dedicated [moderation team](https://hub.fosstodon.org/team/), I don't think I could do it anymore. I don't even do moderation, but I still spend hours a day on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/about) related tasks. It's quite literally a part time job for me. Add that to my full time job, my wife and my family, and my newly time consuming college classes (I'm done with my Freshman year!!), there's no time for anything else. I just want to say a hearty **thank you** to our mods for all the hard work they do, and wish the team over at emacs.ch the best of luck in the future.
