It's been a while.

I saw a [recent blog post](https://kevquirk.com/on-this-site-and-financial-stability) by my friend Kev over on his blog and was impressed that it's doing so well. I feel marginally guilty that my own blog has been moldering away for close to a year with no activity at all. I'm sure that anybody that ever bothered to look at this space has long forgotten about it. Still, since I have it I wanted to put something up, if only to refresh the muscle memory it takes to get one of these things posted.

So, what is this thing about? Pretty much nothing. I don't have any grand plan for this post other than to put some words into vim and have it come out in [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com). I think I've succeeded. There are words.
