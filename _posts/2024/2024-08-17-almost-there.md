Today I finished the penultimate project for the class I'm taking. One more week and we're done.

It sometimes feels odd to be back in school at this point in my life. I have a family and a full time job, so I can't dedicate the time required to be a full time student. Instead, I 
sign up for a class or two at a time, and burn through them as fast as I can. My current class is Web Development, which entails basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've taken HTML before,
but it was the 90s and a lot has changed since then. CSS and Javascript are both new animals to me. I've got a fancy stylesheet for this website, but it's [SimpleCSS](https://simplecss.org),
which was written in its entirety by [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev), so I can't take any credit for it. I have 8 weeks to complete 15 lessons. Today was the second to last one.

One more week, and the last one is a doozy. One last project and it's to build a website in it's entirety using all the fancy techniques they've taught us in the last seven weeks. Honestly,
I'm looking forward to it. This last "project" was project planning, and there was no code involved. It's the project I feel most worried about from this "semester" (I have a really hard time
calling eight weeks a semester, but technically it is). I'm also looking forward to being done.

I can use a break from this school stuff, even if it's just for a couple weeks. There are other potential time sinks coming my way, so I'll have to hurry up and rest.

Day 2 of the #100DaysToOffload Series.
