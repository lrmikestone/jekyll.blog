I'm a huge fan of web comics, and I read several on a day to day basis. There are some that are no longer being updated, whether it's because 
the author lost interest or the story reached a logical conclusion. One of my favorites to this day is called [Alice Grove](https://www.alicegrove.com).

Originally Alice Grove was a Tumblr site, but since Tumblr pretty much kicked it, you can view all of Alice Grove over on the site for another, very
different comic by the same author. Alice's new home is [here](https://www.questionablecontent.net/alice1.html). Originally there were 200+ comics, but
the author Jeph Jacques has since moved it to only 4 pages containing all the original works.

As a brief aside, I'm a pretty big fan of [Questionable Content](https://www.questionablecontent.net) as well, where some of the same themes carry over
in a very different environment.

If you're a web comic reader, and you have some space in your RSS feed, I'd highly suggest both Alice Grove and Questionable Content. Alice is complete,
so give yourself an hour and you can burn through the whole series. Questionable Content has been going for over 20 years, and is still going strong. I 
can't recommend either too much.
