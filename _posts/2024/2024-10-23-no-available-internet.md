Well, that's not exactly true, but close enough. 

I'm sitting here, and there's a guest WiFi hotspot here. I pull out my laptop and connect to it like a blithering idiot connecting to random hotspots with no concern for my security. Does it work? Well, kinda? 

I can't tell how fast the connection is. It won't connect to anything on the web. I was able to pull down the repo that drives my web site, so I'm thinking that I'll actually be able to publish this when I'm done typing it. I tried doing some brief updates to the system, and _some_ of it work, but not all of it.

This kind of harkens back to my earlier post about how my computer is virtually all web based applications. I have a computer here, and I _could_ be doing all kinds of things, but none of those things are installed. Instead, I find myself complaining in a blog post written in vim. 

At least there's vim. vim always works, no matter where you are. Thanks vim.
