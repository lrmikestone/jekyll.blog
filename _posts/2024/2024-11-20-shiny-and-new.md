It's been a long time since I've done a refresh of my default desktop. Things have been running pretty well, but it was definitely feeling it's age. Finally, I decided to get to it.

Things have been going pretty well honestly. I'm migrating from an older, more expensive machine that I've been using as my default desktop to a newer, inexpensive machine. The old machine, which has a decent and wasted GPU in it, will be migrating to a server system to consolidate the collection of VMs and Raspberry Pis I've got running around my house. I'm too old and too busy to be bothered to keep track of updates and maintenance on all this stuff. By consolidating it down into a more capable single system I'm going to be saving myself time and effort.

The new system isn't anything fancy, but my personal needs are pretty minimal. I literally spend upwards of 95% of my time in a browser or a terminal. Those two things don't require a massive system to run. I've only run into a single issue, and that's with sound. Apparently the sound board on my new system isn't particularly happy with Linux. It works, but only is dumping audio through the HDMI port. It just doesn't want to play audio through that handy dandy port I've got my external speakers plugged into. Tomorrow I'm going to get a USB adapter to plug my speakers into, and hopefully that'll solve my problem. I've also got some rearranging to do on my desk to compensate for the different footprint. 

The other thing that's changed is I've moved from Zorin 16.3 to.... _drumroll_ .... Zorin 17.2. Yep, I'm that boring. What can I say? Zorin is a solid distro that lets me be as lazy as I want to be and still keep me in a decent desktop experience. I've got my browser and my terminal, and I'm perfectly happy. I'm also migrating from VSCode, which I installed for one of my college classes and have been using to do blog posts as well, back to a much more simple Ghostwriter. That's more of an impulse choice at the moment. I used Ghostwriter years and years ago, and when I searched for markdown in the software store it was one of the first choices that popped up. I might find something new and interesting to replace it eventually, but for the time being it's doing the job. 

I'll let you know how things go with the audio. Eventually.
