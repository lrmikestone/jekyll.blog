I've finally finished my final project for my current class. There's nothing to do now but wait and see how it call came out.

I think I'm going to be sleeping really well tonight. The last couple nights have been full of dreams of websites, HTML, and CSS code. It's not what I'd call "restful". 
I guess the bright side of that is there were several ideas my sleeping brain kicked up to my conscious mind that were actually useful. There were other ideas that I had
that weren't exactly bad, but didn't really fit into the project I working on. Some of those may see the light of day on this page if I can find the time to dust off
these old files. I haven't looked at half of them since I put this page up.

Tomorrow, I'm sleeping in. Even though the final project was due today, I did manage to leave the house and do some chores outside (before it got too hot) and checked some
things off my ToDo list. Of course, there are still things on that ToDo list, so I can't slack all day, but I do want to appreciate that I can take a breather for a few hours
before chaos reigns once again on Monday.

Day 9 of the #100DaysToOffload Series.
