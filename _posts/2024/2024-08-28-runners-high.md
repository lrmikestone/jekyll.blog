I've recently started running again. It's been a while. For a long time, I did rotating days of a quick mile and a slow three miles. I stopped after I injured my left ankle somehow. I'm not sure what I did to it. I'm American, so I didn't bother to go to the doctor and have it looked at. Things are starting off again pretty slowly, but I did want to briefly talk about the runner's high.

For those of you who don't know, a "runner's high" is, as [defined by Nike](https://www.nike.com/a/runners-high-benefits), a brief state of euphoria following a run. The sensation can leave you feeling calm and more relaxed than what you’d typically expect to feel after a high-intensity workout. For example, instead of ending a run feeling a little worn out and sore, a runner’s high can make you feel energized and fresh post-run. I can say unequivocally and without a shadow of a doubt, this is something that I've never, _ever_ experienced.

For me, running is a constant slog. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say I absolutely hate every single minute of it. I do it for two reasons.

1. It helps me stay in shape and keep my weight under control.
2. If I can make myself run, everything else I need to make myself do over the course of the day feels easy by comparison.

I chose now to get back into it because it's still too hot to be outside for extended periods of time. It has actually gotten cooler than it was, and today it reached a high of only 103F (40C). The cooler yet still hot weather means I need to get things done earlier in the day or I'm not going to be able to do it until after dark. Some of the areas I run are unpaved trails, and running on them is a good way to injure yourself (again) if you can't see where you're going. So, the weather forces me to get out and do it.

I'm getting better already, after only a couple of weeks. Another month and I hope I'll be back into the multi-mile range. We'll see. Do I think I'll ever experience this "runner's high" I've heard people talk about? 

Absolutely not. I think the best I'll ever be able to hope for is laying on my bedroom floor, a heap of sweaty geezer immensely grateful that my run for the day is over. 

I guess that's kinda close. Kinda.
