A couple of days ago, I [mentioned](https://mikestone.me/20241120-shiny-and-new) that I had resumed using Ghostwriter after a while of just using VSCode to edit my blog. I think I've found something better.

For those who don't want to click the link, this is what I said a couple days ago:

<blockquote>I installed for one of my college classes and have been using to do blog posts as well, back to a much more simple Ghostwriter. That’s more of an impulse choice at the moment. I used Ghostwriter years and years ago, and when I searched for markdown in the software store it was one of the first choices that popped up. I might find something new and interesting to replace it eventually, but for the time being it’s doing the job.</blockquote>

Now, Ghostwriter is fine. It's fine, but one thing I missed a lot from VSCode was having my folder list on the left so I can casually move between files. The functionality is _kinda_ there, but only kinda. It wasn't really tickling my fancy. It did the job, but only barely.

I started looking around again, and I found [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev). Pulsar is a continuation of the old Atom editor, which was [discontinued](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/sunsetting-atom/) a few years back. I really liked Atom, but there's only so long you can use softare with no updates. Eventually, things just break, and I didn't want to be using it when that happened. Pulsar seems to have all the features I like, even the integration with Github. Ghostwriter did _not_ have that.

I expect this will be the one to replace VSCode, but I guess keep an eye on this space in case I change my mind in a couple days. Stranger things have happened.
