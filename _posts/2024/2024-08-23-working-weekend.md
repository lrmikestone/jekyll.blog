It's Friday and the weekend is here! Sorta. Work is complete for the week, but my final project for my class is due tomorrow, and there's still work to be done.

Friday nights are usually a time where you can kick back and think about the week that's just gone by, have a frosty beverage, and just relax a little. That's not this weekend. 

This week has been a real doozy. I'm not going to go into details right now, but let's just say my stress level is through the roof. As most of you know, I'm the admin of [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org), but this has absolutely nothing to do with that. All my stress is not something I can escape from simply by logging off for a couple hours. I could really use a little kickback and relax time. Unfortunately, it just so happens that this week is also the last week for my college course, and we have our final projects due tomorrow. 

So, as they say, no rest for the wicked. Back to the grind. Everybody have a good weekend.

Day 8 of the #100DaysToOffload Series.
