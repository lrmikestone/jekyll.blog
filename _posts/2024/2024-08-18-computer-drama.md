I think anybody that's spent any time in the computer industry just has one of those days where things don't go the way you'd like. Today, my youngest son had that kind of a day.

So, a little bit of backstory. 

A couple weeks ago, he was sitting at his computer playing some game. He's a fan of video games, and spends a good portion of his waking time not spent in school playing video games. 
I think everybody has heard a similar story before.

According to a later retelling, a sudden thing in the game startled him, and he jumped. This isn't unusual as some of the games he plays are horror games, a "jump scare" is almost guaranteed. So,
he jumps and his knee hits his desk and the resultant jarring of the desk tips over a cup of water he's got sitting right next to his laptop. * Sploosh * 

Now, is he supposed to have water next to his laptop? No he is not.

Has he been told not to put water next to his laptop? Yes he has.

Has he listened to old geezers telling him to not put water next to his laptop? Of course not because he's always _super_ careful, and nothing bad will _ever_ happen with water right next to his computer.

Of course, there's screaming and jumping and upside down computers and bags of rice and desiccant. 

Long story short, the computer seemingly recovers and after a day or two of "drying time" he goes about his merry way playing his games (no water next to his computer this time).

Fast forward to today. He goes to sit at his computer to play a video game with his brother, and the computer doesn't turn on. He tries for a while with no luck. Mom gets brought in and she tries for a while,
also with no luck. Dad gets brought in (that's me!), and he tries for a while, also with no luck. All the possibilities haven't been exhausted and the triage is still ongoing, but my son is learning the hard
way that sometimes it's just easier for everybody if you listen to your parents and don't put water right next to your laptop.

Maybe there'll be more on this later.
