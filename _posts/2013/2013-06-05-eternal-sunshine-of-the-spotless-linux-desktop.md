How often do you stop to look at your desktop? I can honestly say, I look at my desktop more or less depending on what OS I'm using. Is that weird?

## Scientific Study

Today at work, I received a new project. That's not terribly relevant other that it's what spurred a revelation. While thinking about how I was going to go about solving a particular problem, I suddenly realized that I was staring blankly at my desktop.

My computer at work is a crappy Windows 7 box that has the hardest time with the most basic tasks. For me to say that I don't like it would be an understatement, but today I noticed something different. My desktop is a _huge_ mess. There are literally icons and folders scattered everywhere.

Why is this interesting? Well, it's probably not in all honesty, but this is not typical behavior for me. I usually keep things pretty pristine. I like the minimal desktop look, and having icons and folders scattered is _not_ minimal. After some brief cleanup, and was walking to get lunch, and as I walked through a row of cubicles, I was noticing other people's desktops too. To a person, they looked like mine. Disaster areas. Garbage scattered hither and yon. Every Windows desktop seemed to be that way.

Finally my day ends, and I'm able to sit down at my home computer for a second. I breathe a sigh of relief when I see my spotless Linux desktop happily waiting for me to do something. Ironically, that something happened to be digging through my old screen shots. As it turns out, every screen shot I've ever taken of Windows is piles of icons. Everywhere. Every screen shot I've taken of Linux is neatly organized with a fairly minimal desktop.

Does using Linux make me more organized? My "Scientific Study" says Yes! And when I say "Scientific" I mean "Not Scientific at all". Seriously, this "study" ranks right up there with [studies funded by Microsoft "proving" that Windows is more secure or less expensive than Linux](http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-975938.html). We're talking utter crap here.

## The Question

Still, it's interesting to me that I work so much differently when I use Linux vs. when I use Windows. Is it more than just me? Go back through your screen shots if you have them. Are you more organized when you're using Linux than Windows?
