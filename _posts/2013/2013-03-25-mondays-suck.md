The clock on my computer is telling me that it's 11:20 AM. It's Monday, and everything has sucked today.

## Work

Work drug me out of bed this morning with unresponsive web servers. Intermittent issues are always the worst. Took two hours to track down a web app that was only generating an error on one node of the cluster. Restarted the app and everything worked like a charm.

## Phone

I decided last night that I wanted to root my phone. After [the ICS update](http://linuxrants.com/2013/02/ice-cream-sandwich-for-the-htc-thunderbolt/ "Ice Cream Sandwich for the HTC Thunderbolt") it's been running so slowly sometimes it takes minutes to just make a call. Apps are barely usable. It's pathetic really. I found a nice little article over on Lifehacker titled "[How to Root the HTC Thunderbolt](http://lifehacker.com/5886887/how-to-root-the-htc-thunderbolt)". Seems promising since it's only a couple months old.

First complication: "you'll just need to download the batch script on this page, run it on your Windows machine, and follow all the instructions." Ewww, Windows.

OK, this can be dealt with.

I fire up a Windows machine, download the necessary crap, and get my phone in a state that the app requires. OK, let's fire this baby up!

Not only did the phone spontaneously restart, the Windows machine BSODed. I tried it twice more (because I'm stubborn that way) with the same results. It amazes me that people use Windows. What kind of POS operating system takes a complete dump running a glorified batch file? Finally gave up because I have work to do.

## Tablet

My tablet is an old beater [HP TouchPad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_TouchPad) that's hacked to run [CM9](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/). Most days it does alright for itself, but lately everything is crashing all the time. I'm not sure if these later CM9 nightlys are just less stable or if the tablet is going down the crapper. Apps like GMail crash. Maps doesn't even install due to some weird conflict. Google+ crashes. SwiftKey works but the tablet doesn't seem to recognize that you're typing on it so you can't enter text. I get weird digital garbage in the conversation when I use Skype or Google Talk.

I'm about ready for something (_ANYTHING_) to work today. So damn frustrating. Mondays suck.
