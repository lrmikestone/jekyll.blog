We've been hearing a lot about Prism lately. It's a big topic and a big deal. I hear excuses for it all the time. "If you're not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about." "It's for our security!" Blah blah blah. None of the many excuses I've heard have remotely justified Prism to me. That's one of the many reasons that I rely on Linux to protect my privacy.

## Microsoft and the NSA

If you're using Windows, and you want to protect your privacy, you can spend a lot of money to do it. You can buy packages that will protect Windows. You can upgrade your firewalls. You can install virus and malware protection. You can encrypt your files.

Do you honestly think that will protect you from the NSA and having your data sucked down at will by Prism? Of course it won't.

The trick here is that [Microsoft allegedly is working with the NSA](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/07/12/report-microsoft-nsa/2511857/). They're giving the NSA access and allowing them to bypass their encryption. Nothing you're installing to protect your privacy is working.

Now, Microsoft has denied that this is the case. What we now have is a case of he said she said regarding your privacy. Who do you believe? And that's the billion dollar question.

## Any OS can be Secured, Sorta

Microsoft would have you believe that Windows can be just as secure as Linux, and they're doing everything in their power to protect your privacy. The thing is, you have to take their word for it. And that's not just the case with Windows and Microsoft. It's the case with any proprietary OS where the code is locked away from the customer. We can't look and see if what Microsoft is telling us is true. We can't look and see what Apple is telling us is true.

It's hidden.

This is where Linux by it's very nature is better. The code is open, and anybody with an Internet connection can download that code and verify that no NSA snoop has a back door to their operating system. Just by being open, Linux does more to protect your privacy than Microsoft and Apple combined. Combine Linux with tor, and you're virtually invisible. On top of that, you don't have to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars to achieve this. It's all free.

## Protect Your Privacy

Even before Prism, I had a hard time coming up with a good reason to use Windows. Now, post Prism, continuing to use Windows or OSX seems like you're just wrapping your private affairs in a pretty bow as a gift for anybody that Microsoft or Apple makes a deal with. If you're even slightly interested in keeping your private matters private, you should be using Linux.
