A long, long time ago on an operating system that resembled Linux but wasn’t, I used to use emacs. In the years since, I’ve migrated away to [several different editors](https://mikestone.me/my-text-editor-of-choice), but I’ve never really spent much time in emacs since. I’m thinking of giving it another go.

I recently watched a “[First Look](https://youtu.be/iXPS_NHLj9k)” at SpaceVim by [DistroTube](https://mastodon.technology/@distrotube), and it looked really interesting. I’ve been using vi/vim for close to twenty years now, and I’m not even all that good at it. It’s such a powerful tool. I also like to keep things pretty much vanilla because then I’m not used to configuration being there when I move to a server that I don’t have complete control over. 

Still, SpaceVim looked interesting enough to give a go. It was a quick, easy install and away I went with SpaceVim.

During the first look at SpaceVim, DT mentioned Doom Emacs several times. I don’t really use Emacs, and I rarely extend those applications anyway, so I’d never heard of it. I liked SpaceVim enough that Doom Emacs caught my attention.

I’ve heard over and over again how versatile Emacs is. From what I can tell, you can do pretty much anything with it, from file managers to window managers to media players, ad nauseum. 

I haven’t been super interested in any of that stuff now for longer than some of my friends have been alive, but for some reason this time it struck my fancy.

Today, I installed Doom Emacs, and I’m going to try this thing for the first time in longer than I care to say. Wish me luck.
