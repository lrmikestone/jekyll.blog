Aaaaannnnnd we're done. The house is empty. Nothing to do now except turn in the keys.

<!--more-->

This move has been a lot of work. We've been going constantly for over a month now getting the new place ready to move in and moving our stuff over. Cleaning the old house so it's ready for whoever comes after us. I'm exhausted. I told my wife a week ago that this Saturday, I'm doing nothing. I'm sitting on the couch and letting the world pass by. We still have a lot of stuff to do with the new house. It's cluttered with boxes that were urgently moved and then stacked in corners and along walls. We haven't had a chance to fully _move in_ we've been so busy _moving out_. 

We have a last minute cleaning crew coming in about 30 minutes. They're going to do the deep cleaning stuff we just don't have the equipment, inclination, or time to get done by today. 

As exciting as it is having this new house and getting ready to make it _ours_, it's still sad to see the old place empty. It echoes weirdly without our stuff in it.
