On the 8th of August, 2024 [I was challenged](https://fosstodon.org/@yabozdar/112928345387481546) to complete the [100 Days To Offload](https://100daystooffload.com). This is a challenge I've [successfully completed before](https://100daystooffload.com/#-hall-of-fame-:~:text=Name%3A%20Mike%20Stone%0AWebsite%3A%20https%3A//mikestone.me%0ADate%20completed%3A%20December%202020), but have failed even more. This new challenge came with an even tighter timeline, to complete it by the end of the calendar year. So, how did it go?

Badly. It went badly. 

By the end of the calendar year, I'd completed 31 out of the 100 posts I was hoping to complete. You don't have to be good at math to understand that's not close. So, it's hard to call this anything other than what it is, and that's abject failure. Still, the 100 Days to Offload challenge is for a full year, not the 4 months specified in this new challenge, so that was still a possibility. So, how did _that_ go?

Badly. It went badly.

By August 16th, 2025 I'd completed a whopping 46 out of the 100 posts I needed to make to complete the challenge. 

So, in the first 138 days, I completed 31 posts. That's one post every 4 to 5 days or so. Not great. I wouldn't have completed the 100 Days at that rate if I'd kept that pace. In the next 227 days, I completed only 15 more posts, which is about one post every 15 days or so. That's approximately 2 posts per month, which would have given me a total of 24 posts in a year. I did manage to beat that number, thankfully. 

So, what's the excuse here? I mean, writing a blurb every 3 or 4 days shouldn't be that hard, right? It's not like this needs to be War and Peace. Just a quick little something about something.

I think the biggest issue for me is that my desire to write comes in waves. Sometimes I have things I want to talk about, and other times I won't even post on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org) for days at a time. Also, I've traditionally written mostly about technology, which is a field I've felt [particularly burnt out on](https://mikestone.me/2025-04-28-do-what-you-love) lately. Once upon a time, I'd track the news for the latest and greatest stuff. These days most of my tech is years old and I dread even running updates. 

What else could I write about then? 

Well, I have a family and I have a job. I could write about that stuff, I just don't want to. 

For the privacy of my wife and kids, I don't like to get too much into discussing them. I'm happily married, and I have kids that don't seem to completely hate me at this point, and that's usually where I'll draw the line. 

I could write about my job I suppose, but there's quite a bit of crossover between my job and technology since I work in a technology based job. The previously mentioned burn out comes into play here. There's also the fact that I work in a field where privacy is a huge factor and there's a lot of concern about corporate secrets. I'm contractually not supposed to mention a lot of what I do or who I do it for, so that would only make writing about the job in a field I'm burnt out on more complicated and annoying for everybody.  

So, if I'm not writing about my family, and I'm not writing about my job, and I'm not writing about technology, what do I write about? 

I think the answer is obvious at this point: I don't.

I suppose I could write about school. For those who don't know, I'm an approximately 50 year old college student. Next week I start the oh so exciting class of English 101. Seriously. Maybe I'll regail you with tales of nouns and verbs and dangling participles? For some reason I don't see that happening. 

Another class I have coming up is I'm going to be taking a photography course. I require some humanities credits, and I like taking pictures. I'm what most people with cameras would refer to as a "rank amateur" (heavy on the "rank"), but I enjoy doing it. Maybe that'll be enough to kick off a blog post or two. I guess we'll see. 

OK, time to wrap things up before I meander further from the point. 100 Days to Offload? Failed. Super failed. Excuse excuse excuse. Moving on. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.
