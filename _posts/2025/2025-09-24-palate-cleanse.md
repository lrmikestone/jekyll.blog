Contrary to how it might seem, I've been writing quite a bit lately. I just haven't been writing here. I'm taking a break from that writing to do some writing here because I need a bit of a palate cleanse.

Some might remember that I mentioned that I'm back in class this fall, and I'm taking an English class. I'm not going to delve into details as to the _why_ I'm taking a freshman English course, suffice to say that I am. I've elected to compress my schedule down to eight weeks instead of the standard sixteen just so I can get this thing over and done, but that means multiple writing assignments per week. 

See, here's the thing. I like writing. It's fun. It lets me take the ideas that are banging around between my ears and put them out into the world. That helps me quiet the noise in my head. I won't claim to be particularly good at it, but being a crap writer doesn't take the enjoyment out of it. The problem I'm running into is writing on a schedule about a topic I couldn't care less about takes the joy out of writing. It's like taking a nice, juicy orange and putting it into a juicer. When you're done squeezing every last drop of goodness out of that orange, you throw away the juice and keep the dried and crushed remnants. That's what my writing feels like right now. 

I'm halfway through this class, and I only have maybe six or seven more papers to write. I'm also starting another class in five days: Photography. I'm hoping that class doesn't do for photography what English has done for my writing. I enjoy taking pictures. It's fun, and if I can capture even a fraction of the beauty in the world and preserve it in a photo to share with others, I consider that a success. 

I'm looking forward to being done with this class. I was hoping to write more on this blog, but after this class I'm think I'm going to need to step away from the keyboard for a while just to try to cram some of that juice back into the orange. Sadly, I was really hoping this class would inspire me to write more and maybe even get back into the habit of writing regularly. Now, I just don't think that's going to happen. At least not for a while.
