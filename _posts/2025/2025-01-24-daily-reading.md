Reading list for January 24th, 2025.

<!--more-->

These are articles I read today. The appearance of an article in this list does not mean I endorse it's content or support it's source or author. It's just something I read. Take it with a grain of salt. It's not in any particular order other than the order I put them into this list. That includes chronological order. These are things I read today, not necessarily things that were written today. Check dates if you decide to read something from this list.
