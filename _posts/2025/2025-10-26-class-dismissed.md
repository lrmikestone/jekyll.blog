It's done!!! I'm so happy it's done!!

<!--more-->

Well, to be fair, it's been done for a week now, but I couldn't bring myself to write anything since then. Things didn't go poorly, but it was a lot of work for a 100 level class. 

This isn't my first run through college, but I don't remember things being this intense last time. I mean, it could have something to do with the fact that last time I was a full time student and this time I'm a full time parent and I have a full time job in addition to all the school work. There's a lot more on my plate this time than was there was last time. Also, my grades are significantly better this time, so there's that. They say Cs get degrees, and that's true which I can verify from last time, but I guess I have a different impression of that philosophy than I did my first experience. 

Regardless, I've moved on to my next class. Art. Photography. 

Again, it's a 100 level class, but this one makes me very nervous. I guess they all make me nervous on some level, but I'm not what most people would call "creative" or "artistic," so this is definitely a stretch class for me. It's already more fun than the last one, and I do enjoy taking my camera out when I can. The hardest part about this (other than trying to pretend to be creative and artistic) is just finding the time to get out and take photos. The professor has a solid list of "do not take photographs of," which includes a pretty much everything I usually take pictures of, and he's very particular about the types of photos he wants taken. He seems very into urban candids. That's fine and all, but I don't live in a super urban area, and it's a pretty hefty drive to get one one. I have to do it when it doesn't directly conflict with my job and family stuff. 

I'm probably exaggerating a little here. The class is a couple weeks in, and what I've turned in I'm doing well with. If you do the MikeOne/MikeTwo I talked about [in my last post](https://mikestone.me/2025-10-09-getting-grades), MikeOne is happy, but MikeTwo knows we're not far enough into the class to have a passing grade even if I'd gotten 100% of the currently available points. This is October and the class goes until the week before Christmas, so that's to be expected. Still, there's a lot of hard work remaining to get this done right, so no sitting back and relaxing for quite a while.
