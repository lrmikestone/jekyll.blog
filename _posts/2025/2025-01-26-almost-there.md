I know I've written about this multiple times by now, but it seriously is about the only thing I'm doing right now. We're done with the old house on Friday, and today is Sunday. Five days and we're done. Almost there.

<!--more-->

It's 7:37PM (19:37), and I've been moving and packing stuff for close to 12 hours. Our new house is close to the old house, so we've been combining the packing and unpacking process. Kinda. We pack up a load of stuff at the old house, throw as much into the back of our Toyota Highlander as we can fit, and drive to the new house. Some stuff is getting unpacked right away, and some isn't. What isn't is building up in columns of boxes that will need to be dealt with next week. What is is being unpacked into it's respective locations. Once the boxes are empty, we put them back into the Highlander and drive back to the old house and do it all over again. Both houses are two story, and according to my FitBit (grain of salt here) I've gone up 178 flights of stairs today. Your guess is as good as mine how accurate that is, but I can confirm I've gone up and down the stairs today. A lot. I sat down at my computer today for the first time while I'm grabbing something quick to eat before heading back over for what I hope will be at least one more run before I gotta get the kids off to bed. I'm probably going to fall down hard when this is all over, and I've already told my wife I'm doing as little as possible next Saturday. We've been at this for weeks now, and weekends are harder than weekdays. Weekdays I have to sit at my computer to do my job. Weekends I'm off so I don't have that benefit. Still, I might have to take some time off work this week to finish things up. 

Time is running short.

Almost there.
