I wonder if the reason I'm so garbage at updating my blog is the same reason I'm garbage at email.

There's something about updating a blog that feels like it requires some introspection. Some thought. You can just toss off a social media post, and if it's trash no one really thinks to much about it. If feels ephemeral.

A blog post feels more concrete. More static and permanent. In my head I feel like this thing I'm writing now could be around for literal decades. That could be because some of the garbage posts I made decades ago are [still on this blog](https://mikestone.me/why-linux/). Not only are they still here, but they're still something anybody on the Internet can read.

I mean, my [Why Linux](https://mikestone.me/why-linux/) post is 23 years old. How am I going to feel about this post 23 years from now?

I don't even like doing email, and that's not nearly as public or permanent. Still, it feels like it's an investment. It's a _letter_ basically. Something someone else may keep. Something someone else will control once I hit that Send button. I feel like I need to get it right the first time. I need to make sure my ideas are represented accurately and completely. If someone reads that email in 20 years, are they going to know what the hell I'm talking about? Will what I'm saying even make any sense?

I realize that this is a lot of pressure to put on an email, or even a blog post. I didn't say it made logical sense. I just think it might be my hang-up when it comes to blogs or email.
