I ran across one of those click-bait articles today about 12 questions smart people hate being asked. I'm not going to link you to the article because it absolutely is stupid click-bait and I don't want you clicking their stupid crap links.

What I will do is give you the questions that the article said smart people hate being asked so you don't have to click the link and be annoyed by the advertising.

1. What's your IQ?
2. Are you always this quiet?
3. What's the point of thinking all the time?
4. Why do you care so much about that topic?
5. Do you always ask so many questions?
6. What's the meaning of life?
7. Can you solve this problem for me?
8. Why do you overanalyze everything?
9. Shouldn’t you have all the answers?
10. Don't you ever have fun?
11. Why do you always need to be right?
12. Do you think you’re smarter than everyone else?

Now, I can honestly say that I almost never get asked any of those questions. I think there's two reasons for that.                                                                                              
1. I'm not actually that smart.
2. I like to surround myself with people who are smarter than I am.

Now, number one has a lot to do with the number two. Because I choose to associate myself with people who are smarter than I am, I realize that there are people who are so much smarter than I am in basically all respects, so the realization regarding my own intelligence is impossible not to reach. If you're a person who doesn't surround yourself with smart people, that odd person out who is intelligent probably sta
nds out quite a lot more.

I'm not claiming I'm stupid either. I'm on the smarter side of the bell curve, but half the people in the world are, so that's not much to brag about. Despite that, I find these questions really odd. I guess I
'll have to defer to people who are smarter than I am. Do people really ask you these things enough for it to be annoying?
