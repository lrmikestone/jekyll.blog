I'm not much of a football guy. I played in highschool, but I'm not the sort that knows the plays and the players and the coaches and everything they've ever done their entire careers. I do appreciate a good game though.

The Superbowl is quite probably the only professional game I'll see this year. My kids have a habit of monopolizing the TV, and I have enough on my plate with being a parent, working full time, being the admin of [a mastodon server](https://fosstodon.org), going to college, and trying to keep our house in working order to keep me busy most weekends.

So, Chiefs vs. Eagles. Again. I can say with complete honesty I don't care one bit who wins this thing. I'd probably lean towards the Eagles just because the Chiefs have already done it enough times, but I'm not going to lose sleep either way.
