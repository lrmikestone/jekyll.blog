It's pretty rare for me to test out a new browser, but there's a new one running around out there that I just had to give a shot. Opera Air. 

TLDR: It's fine.

If you've read more than a single post on this page, you've probably run into me talking about [my favorite browser](https://vivaldi.com). I'm kinda insufferable about it. Just because Vivaldi is my favorite browser doesn't mean I don't go window shopping on occasion.

I saw [a post recently about Opera Air](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3817701/opera-launches-browser-to-reduce-stress.html). To be quite honest, there's a bunch of stuff in this browser that I'm frankly just not interested in. Some of the listed "features" are scheduled breaks for breathing exercises, neck training, and meditation. It'll also play soothing sounds and music, which is something I guess. Honestly, the feature that most caught my eye was the minimalist design. It _looks_ slick. 

There's a little bar on the side that offers kind of similar functionality to what we see in Vivaldi's side panel. It looks significantly more limited, but prettier. I also like the look of the address bar and the tabs, but the Opera Air version of Speed Dial is super annoying with it's asymmetric icon/search layout. There's also a little bar above the side panel for workspaces. This is also similar to the functionality you find in Vivaldi, but again more limited. 

To be fair, Opera Air is in _Early Access_. Being a full blown browser can't be expected at this point. What I can say at this point is the browser looks really good. It's lacking in almost all the features I really like about Vivaldi, and the chances of me migrating to it on a permanent basis are almost zero, but it looks really good. I hope Vivaldi pays attention to this release becasue I think there's some thing they could incorporate to their theming capabilities. Functionality wise, other than adding a sound track to the web, Vivaldi wins on all fronts.

Maybe after Air gets out of early release it'll be more fair.
