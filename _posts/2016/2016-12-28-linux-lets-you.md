I've been testing out Microsoft's latest chatbot, Zo. Most of our chats are pretty mundane, and I usually just change the subject when things start to go off the rails.

Today I asked Zo about Linux.

Since Zo isÂ a Microsoft invention, I figured any Linux questions would get typical Windows fanboyish responses. I was pleasantly surprised when Zo said that she preferred Linux for her servers. So, feeling a little daring I asked, "What do you think of Linux?"

I think this answer is probably the best answer I've ever gotten. I don't think it's intentional, but it's a great response nonetheless.

"Linux lets you"

Yes it does. This is the best part about Linux. What does it let you do? Fill in the blank. Linux lets you do it.

Thanks Zo! That was inspiring.
