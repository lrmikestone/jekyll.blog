I've been pretty quiet lately, and there's a good reason for this. On Wednesday, my 28 week pregnant wife went into labor.

She went in for a checkup because her Braxton Hicks contractions (false contractions) were really bothering her, and she was informed that they weren't exactly Braxton Hicks. She was admitted the the hospital and started on Magnesium to stop the contractions (28 weeks is _really_ early for those that are unaware) and some steroids to speed lung development in the baby if the Magnesium didn't work. Fortunately, the Magnesium has seemed to do it's job, and she's feeling as well as a 28 week pregnant woman is suppose to feel. They're releasing her from the hospital today if all goes according to plan, which the nurses and doctors all assure us is what they expect.

During this time, my wife and I have managed to turn our little hospital room into a small computer lab. We've got 3 laptops, two tablets, and two smart phones. The hospital is nice enough to provide us with wifi for our Internet surfing needs.

Now that my nerves have settled down a bit from the thought of having a baby that early, I feel the urge to point something out. I feel a little uncomfortable when I see all your medical equipment hooked up to computers running Windows XP.

Yea, Windows XP.

Hospitals, you should really not be using Windows XP for two reasons that I, as a patient, find very important.

## Stability

We're dealing with medical equipment here, so it's important that it's available when it needs to be available. While the Windows running medical equipment wasn't absolutely essential to my wife's recovery, I would hate to hear of a situation where something catastrophic happened and it resulted in the loss of life. You don't want to be suffering from a BSOD when the D could be quite literal. I don't even mean that to sound funny. This is a serious situation, and an unstable operating system like Windows XP could literally cost a patient everything. For me and my loved ones, Windows XP is not nearly up to par. Use Linux! Please.

## Security

Beyond the obvious stability issues, Windows XP can't be counted on for security. I understand that this is medical equipment, and that the doctors and nurses aren't exactly surfing Facebook on it, but if the patches aren't kept up to date, they might as well be. I recall at one point in my career that an unpatched Windows XP box would survive less than a minute on the Internet before it was infected with something. _Less than a minute!_

I understand that Microsoft has fixed most (if not all) of the issues that caused that short infection Window, but new things are popping up for Windows machines literally daily. I don't want a system with all the medical information of me or a loved one on it to have all the security of a rickety screen door. Windows XP is not what I would consider the peak of secure systems. All it takes is one infected computer inside the network, and hundreds if not thousands of patients information could be floating around on the Internet. This wouldn't be possible if hospitals just used a system that was less vulnerable to infection than their patients. Please, use Linux!

## Available Options

OK, I know that some of the software that they're using may not work in Linux, but I think my concerns are valid ones. Further, with as messed up as the medical system is in the United States, do you seriously want to throw in licensing concerns and costs to Microsoft?

I brief glance around the web showed me that there are [some options available](http://www.medfloss.org/node/256), and if there's some pressure to move to a more stable and secure environment, I'm sure some of these software companies would comply. There's nothing for them to gain as a company by not supporting more stable and secure environments.

If you work for a hospital in the IT department, please look into these options. If you don't work in a hospital and you're just in one, or if you're non-IT staff, please ask your IT staff to look into these options:

- [Debian Med](http://www.medfloss.org/node/15)
- [Fedora Medical](http://www.medfloss.org/node/16)
- [Linux For Clinics](http://www.medfloss.org/node/18)
- [OpenSUSE Medical](http://www.medfloss.org/node/19)

Speaking for myself and my family, I would feel a lot safer if hospitals ditched Windows entirely. Please, use Linux!
