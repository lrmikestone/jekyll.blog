I notified own of my coworkers that I was signing off a little early today. The clock hadn't even struck four o'clock in the afternoon, and I was done. Finally, some time off.

I'm not sure when the last time was that I took time off that wasn't a weekend, but it's been a while. We're not talking years here, but definitely months.

I did it again this year it seems. I was talking to an old friend of mine that used to be my manager. He used to get _so_ frustrated with me because I'd forget to do time off until the very last minute, and then I'd just end up taking a month off. He's since moved on to another job, but we keep in touch. At lunch today he wasn't frustrated (because he's not my boss anymore), just laughed when I told him.

Yep, I took so little time off this year that I have five more work days between now and the third of January. None of those are next week, so I'm going to be enjoying some much needed rest. Because of the timing, I thought seriously about doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), but instead decided to be lazy when I could and spend some more time with my kids. Maybe I'll do it next year?
