I've been working from home now for over two years. I like working from home. It's nice. I've recently determined that I'm doing this whole thing wrong.

<!--more-->

I think when I first started working from home, my thoughts about it where along the lines of "I need a home office." In creating this "office" for myself, I modelled what I had at home on what I had at work. A chair. A desk. Blah blah blah. You know the setup.

But why?

I ran across this post on Twitter by accident, and I think this lady has the right idea.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I aspire to achieving my gf&#39;s work from home vibe <a href="https://t.co/YP6EdtTISj">pic.twitter.com/YP6EdtTISj</a></p>&mdash; Conor Bronsdon ðŸŒ” (@ConorBronsdon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConorBronsdon/status/1505988726832263171?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

She's got everything going on that she needs to have to get her work done, but she's doing it in a way that you're not going to find in the typical office building. Sitting here in my office chair at my desk, I feel kind of silly that I've spent so much time in a "setting" that I don't actually enjoy.

Maybe there are people out there that love sitting at a desk in an office chair, but I am not one of those people. It _feels_ official and stuff, but it also gets _really_ uncomfortable over the course of the day.

I think I need to rethink how I'm doing this. I need to rethink how my "office" is configured. I think I need less office, more comfort.
