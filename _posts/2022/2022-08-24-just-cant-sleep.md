Sometimes, you just can't sleep. I'm sitting here browsing the internet on my phone after tossing and turning for a relatively unproductive hour. I just thought I'd throw some stuff on my blog like every sensible human does at two in the morning.

I've been kicking around the idea of using jrnl to write blog posts. For those unfamiliar with [jrnl](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/11/jrnl-is-a-command-line-note-taking-app), it's a quick little journalling/notes app for the command line. You type jrnl and go to town. It would be relatively straight forward to write a script that would dump jrnl entries into a blog post. I was looking around at the idea of it a little tonight, and came to the conclusion that it's a stupid idea and I'm a little embarrassed to have had it. Maybe. I might still do it anyway. For fun. It might still work for doing a generic "Captain's Log" kind of daily post, but it's pretty useless for anything beyond that. We'll see.

Oh, tested positive for Covid today. That sucks. Feeling pretty good ironically. You know, other than I can't sleep. I've got a bit of a cough and earlier had a nasty headache, but other that that so far so good. I'd like to keep it that way and get through this as soon as physically possible.

I'm finally getting a new computer at work. Finally. I've had my current work computer for long enough I've seriously considered "accidentally" dropping it down a flight or two of stairs. I would never actually do that of course. On purpose. Of course I'm supposed to get a new computer at the same time I've got Covid, which means I'm not sure I'm going to be able to actually go in and get it. Go figure.  

I've been playing with the [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/) for several days now. It's a really slick little device. I've had great experience with pretty much every game I've tried. The one exception is one called Race the Sun I think (not going to look it up now). I just can't seem to get the controls to work for that one, which is pretty funny considering the controls are really straight forward. It just won't take the Steam Deck configuration for some reason. I was looking forward to taking it to work on Thursday to plug it into the dock there. We have a USB-C dual monitor/keyboard/mouse setup for work, and I expect that will work _really_ well for the Steam Deck in Desktop mode. I can probably get some really decent work done on it. 

OK, enough rambling. I think I'm going to do something else now. Maybe play the Steam Deck.
