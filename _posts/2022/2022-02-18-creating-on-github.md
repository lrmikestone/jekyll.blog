One of the downsides of having a blog based on Jekyll is your workflow is a little limited. Today I'm trying something entirely new to see if I can make this fly.

Most of the time, I'm creating my posts in Atom. It's connected to GitHub, so all I have to do is click a button to publish my posts. Well, a couple buttons, but you get the idea. It works great, but it's not super accessible if I'm not at my computer.

But....

GitHub allows for editing/creating files directly in a repository. There doesn't seem to be a "copy" option, so I have to dig into an existing post before starting my new one so I can get all the headers and stuff from there. I just don't remember all that stuff without the guide. That part is kinda a bummer, but not a deal breaker.

The other thing is there doesn't seem to be a spell checker. This is important to me. I'm a horrible speller. I'm so bad that sometimes I confuse the spell checkers in word processors. They just throw up their hands and say, "I have no idea what you're going for here." It's handy to have [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai) on my desk so I can ask it how to spell words. I can say the word out loud and get the spelling back. It's _that_ bad. I may have to type out these posts in a word processor and then paste the text into GitHub later just to avoid looking like an illiterate dolt.

The online editor feels a little sluggish too. Not horrible, but again I feel like an offline editor might be a good option and then just paste it into the editor window? Couldn't hurt I suppose.

I think we've gotten past the proof of concept part at least. This _can_ work. I might actually do this sometimes in the future if I'm away from my Atom editor. It's not optimal, but it _is_ functional.
