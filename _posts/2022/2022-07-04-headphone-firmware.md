When I bought my latest phone, I got myself a brand new shiny pair of wireless earbuds free of charge. Historically I haven't had a lot of luck with earbuds. These would turn out to be my favorite. Recently, Google pushed a firmware update, and it caught me off-guard.

So, I'm not what anybody would call an audiophile. I like music. I listen to it often, and I even play several different musical instruments with varying degrees of competence. Mostly not much since I haven't played them much in recent years, but I used to put a lot of effort into it when I was younger and single and a student.

Because I'm not an audiophile, I haven't put a lot of effort into getting the greatest headphones in the world. I like to have a *decent* pair of headphones, but "good enough" is usually good enough for me.

The headphones I have are a pair of Google Pixel Buds. I don't know (or honestly care) which version they are. I didn't choose them. They came free with my phone. They have this little rubbery nub on the top that hooks into your ear that really helps them stay put for me, so they've been the best pair of earbuds I've ever owned. Everything other pair has just constantly fallen out of my ears, making them uncomfortable and not very useful in any situation where you're moving around. Because these stay put, I've been happier with them than any other pair I've had.

Yesterday I wanted to watch a movie on my tablet, and when I connected the buds to the tablet I was notified of a firmware update that was available. I didn't really care because I don't use the "smart" features of the buds. I just want them to play sound and that's about it. Still, I figured why the heck not? What's the worst that could happen?

So, the update goes through and I didn't think much about it. Today I took a brief walk and fired up some music to accompany my trip and there was a *noticeable* difference in how things sounded after the update. Normally when something like this happens, it's for the worse. This is not one of those times. The was significantly better sounding bass, and things sounded much clearer to me. 

This is the same music I have been playing for a while. Same player. Same everything. I'm super glad that I did that firmware update.
