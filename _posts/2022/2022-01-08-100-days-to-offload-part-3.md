HAPPPY NEW YEAR!!

I'm going to do this thing again! For the 3rd time!

<!--more-->

OK, so it's now 2022, which means that 2021 is now over since 2021 and 2022 are mutually exclusive. That means my 2021 version of the 100DaysToOffload series is done, even though I didn't finish it.

Didn't finish it?

Yea, it wasn't even close. I missed it by 64 posts I think? Out of one hundred, that's.... uhh.... a lot.

Despite my grand failure in the 2021 version of 100DaysToOffload, I'm going to try doing this thing again. But, I'm going to do things a little bit differently this time around I think.

How you ask?

Well, I won't say I put _a_ _lot_ of pressure on myself regarding my posts. I'm not going to be earning a ribbon for quality and/or depth or anything, but I do feel like there's a very specific set of things that I can write about. More than that, there's a very particular way that I need to write about those things. If I have a quick thought, I feel like I have to go into depth about that thing rather than just post my thought and move on. I think this year I'm going to change that.

That being said, I don't think I'll never post in a more long form manner. That's still going to happen, but I will allow myself some more brief postings. After all, when [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) first proposed the 100DaysToOffload, he specifically wrote this:

>Posts don’t need to be long-form, deep, meaningful, or even that well written. If there are spelling and grammar mistakes, or even if there’s no real point to the post, so what? What’s important is that you’re writing about the things you want to write about.

I have done a horrible job of taking that bit to heart. This year, I'm going to try harder. If I do, maybe I can pull this the 100 days off again.

Here's hoping, and again, HAPPY 2022!!

Day 1 of the #100DaysToOffload 2022 Series.
