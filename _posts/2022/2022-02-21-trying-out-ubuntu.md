When I was younger, I used to try new distros all the time. I even vaguely remember a service that would send me CDs of different distros to install and try. I think that's how I got my hands on Warty Warthog. I tried and used Ubuntu for many years. Somewhere along the way, I started using other distros and I've never really gone back. Until today.

This isn't to say that I'm opposed to Ubuntu. I rarely deviate outside of the "Ubuntu Ecosystem". I use Ubuntu derivatives all the time. One of my primary machines is running Zorin, which is based on Ubuntu. Over the years, I've used Ubuntu Mate, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Zorin, and a host of other distros based on Ubuntu. I just haven't used the actual Ubuntu desktop itself. Just plain old Ubuntu. So, today I thought I'd fire it up to see what's changed.

I'm not going to do a full review of the distro because frankly, I don't want to. I've kind of considered Ubuntu to be one of the default Linux distros for the last ten years or so, so I was surprised to see it in sixth place on [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/index.php), but it still represents. I'm sure most of the people reading this have seen it and tried it before anyway.

I will say that there's been some really interesting refinement since I last used it. There's not a whole lot about the UI that's dramatically different, but it feels more solid and "together"? It's fast and responsive with just enough interface effects to make it feel modern. All told, I wouldn't be opposed to recommending it to a new user, though I'd probably still recommend something with a more familiar UI for those just starting out with Linux. [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) or [Elementary](https://elementary.io/) maybe, or [Zorin](https://www.zorinos.com/).

Despite the refinements of the UI, I'm still not going to be replacing my Zorin desktop or my Manjaro KDE system with Ubuntu any time soon. It's a nice distro though. I don't hate it.
