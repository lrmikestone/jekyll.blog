Microsoft has recently stated that Linux violates several of it's copyrights, and that people using Linux owe Microsoft money for licensing.  Why does this [sound so familiar](http://www.sco.com)?  The old saying, people who don't learn from history are [destined to repeat it](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070810165237718).  I think it would almost be funny for Microsoft to go to court over this and lose massively.  Just the fact that they're threatening Linux tells me that Microsoft is very concerned about it.  That's a good thing for Linux.
