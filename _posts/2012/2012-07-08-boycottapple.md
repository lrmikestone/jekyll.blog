Just wanted to make a quick note about the #boycottapple thing going on on Google+ and on Twitter. I've read several people saying that [boycotting Apple is dumb](http://www.cultofmac.com/177786/why-the-boycott-apple-movement-is-dumb/), and that the real problem is with the patent system. To the people pointing out that the patent system is broken I have one thing to say.

DUH.

We know this people. We're not stupid. Here's the issue though.

The patent system is broken for the entire software industry, so why isn't anybody boycotting EA? Why isn't anybody boycotting Adobe? Why isn't anybody boycotting Attachmate?

The answer is easy. EA, Adobe, and Attachmate aren't acting like assholes. Apple is. Apple is the one going "thermonuclear" on their competitors, and they're the one using the broken patent system to do it.

Does the Software Patent system need to be fixed? I'd argue that it doesn't need to be fixed so much as thrown out altogether, but I think we all agree that it's broken. That's not the point of the #boycottapple "movement" (if you will). The point is that Apple is being a bad player, and because of their behavior, they _should_ be boycotted.
