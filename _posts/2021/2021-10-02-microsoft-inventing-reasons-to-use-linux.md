Windows 11 is coming. Soon. Very soon now actually. [Three days from now](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/) in fact. In it, there are some new reasons to use Linux that Microsoft has created to "make your life better", which is Microsoftese for pushing you towards their products so they can make more money.

I've been keeping an eye on the Microsoft 11 release because there's rumor we may actually be going to it at work sooner rather than later because of how the release is being handled. I'm not going to hold my breath on that one, but I wouldn't be surprised either. I was surprised to see a recent headline.

[Misbehaving Microsoft Teams ad brings down the entire Windows 11 desktop](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/misbehaving-microsoft-teams-ad-brings-down-the-entire-windows-11-desktop/).

I had to have read that wrong, right?

Nope, I didn't read that wrong. Microsoft has actually _embedded_ ads into their OS for their own product, and in doing so crashed their entire OS. To put that another way, they brought their entire OS to its knees with something that honestly has no right to be there in the first place. I'm sure the argument will be made that Windows 11 is a free upgrade from Windows 10, so Microsoft has to pay their bills somehow. Putting ads into their OS is certainly _one_ way to do that. Of course, that argument is a stupid one since Linux is also free and doesn't include garbage ads that will crash the whole system.

Let's be honest about another thing too. This scenario is about as clean as it gets. A Microsoft OS with a Microsoft created advertisement for a Microsoft product. This whole thing is in house. Despite that, they still tanked the whole OS with a corrupted ad. What's going to happen when Microsoft starts to accept ads for other products and services? Are they seriously going to claim they're going to vet all of that stuff manually and verify that it's not going to crash people's computers all across the Internet with literally no notice to them?

I guess I'll be fine with using Windows 11 at work. If the computer crashes I can blame Microsoft and it will have precedent. For my personal use I'll stick to Linux where I don't have to worry that the latest ad from PornHub is going to crash my computer.
