On the 25th of April, 2020, I made my first post after accepting the #100DaysToOffload challenge issued by [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev). I actually managed to complete that challenge on the 6th of December. I haven’t written anything longer than an email since. A new year has begun.

Now that 2021 has started, a whole load of new and interesting things have happened on the technology front since I’ve last written anything. I keep seeing things I feel like commenting on, and then I just don’t get around to do it. 

I’m lacking the _challenge_ that has kept me putting figurative pen to paper that I had last year.

To remedy that situation, and to force myself to keep things moving, I’m re-accepting the 100DaysToOffload challenge. Second verse, same as the first. For those of you who are new or unfamiliar with the 100DaysToOffload challenge, you can read up on it [here](https://100daystooffload.com). The most important part can also sometimes be the hardest for me. “Just. Write.”

So, here we are again in 2021. I’m accepting Kev’s challenge to just write. Let the games begin again!

Day 1 of the 2021 #100DaysToOffload Series.
