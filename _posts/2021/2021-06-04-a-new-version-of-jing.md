I've seen recently that a new version of JingOS is now available for download. [Back in February](https://mikestone.me/jingos-review/), I wrote a personal review of JingOS .6. The new version is .9, so there's probably been quite a few changes since my earlier review. Despite that, I'm not going to review the new version.

Why am I not going to review the new version you ask?

I have very little faith that this thing is going to go anywhere. Not that the company itself isn't working hard, or that their ideas are not good ones. There's just a couple things that are weighing on me regarding this distribution. The biggest for me are these:

1. How they're paying for it. Crowdfunding a tablet? I've seen that crowdfunding thing tried and failed by companies bigger and more experienced than Jingling Tech. I have serious reservations that this is going to pan out.
2. Apple.  They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and it looks like the makers of JingOS _really_ love Apple. In fact, I think they love it a bit _too_ much. JingOS looks so much like iPadOS that it could easilyi be mistaken for it. Even if JingOS manages to gain traction, I think Apple's more litigious nature will be a major obstacle to it going anywhere.

Those are the big ones for me. A Linux based OS on an open source tablet sounds like the promised land, but this feels like it's something that would disappear just as fast as it appeared. I'm seriously hoping I'm wrong.
