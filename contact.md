# Contact Me

You can reach me via [email](mailto:miz4mzt9@duck.com) or on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@mike "Fosstodon").

Also, these days it seems we’re being watched constantly. If you want to send me something a little bit more secure, I have a [Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org) profile [here](https://keyoxide.org/hkp/EBD0831C9202570E2E2483B68555A0ABA3F28D2A).

Keep in mind that I don’t decrypt that stuff on my phone, so if you contact me that way it may take a little longer for a response. Also, if you’d like an encrypted response, you’ll need to send me your public key or at least a place I can look it up.
